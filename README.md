# Logs Agent with Strands Agents

## Aim

To create an AI Agent that can do log analysis

## Setup

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd log-analysis-agent
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure Ollama is running locally (`http://localhost:11434`) with the `llama3.2` model pulled.

## Run

```bash
python logs_agent.py
```


# Log Analysis AI Agent using Python, Ollama & Strands Framework

## 🟦 Situation (Problem / Idea)

In real-world DevOps and production environments, log files continuously grow and contain large amounts of system information, warnings, and errors.

Manually reading logs to identify issues, detect error patterns, and perform root cause analysis becomes time-consuming and inefficient for DevOps engineers.

I wanted to understand how AI Agents can assist DevOps teams by automating intelligent log analysis instead of manually checking application and system logs.

The idea was to build an AI-powered Log Analysis Agent capable of reading log files, understanding log patterns, and providing concise operational insights using Large Language Models.

## 🟦 Task (Responsibility / Goal)

My task was to design and develop an AI Agent that could:

* Read and analyze log files automatically
* Detect occurrences of INFO, WARNING, and ERROR logs
* Summarize log analysis results in a concise format
* Follow a DevOps mindset for troubleshooting and root cause analysis
* Avoid hallucinated responses and unnecessary production actions
* Work locally using an open-source LLM model

The goal was to reduce repetitive manual log analysis effort and improve visibility into application/system issues.

## 🟦 Action (Actual Implementation / Tools / Technologies)

I implemented the project using Python with the Strands Agentic Framework and integrated Ollama-based local LLM models.

### Core Implementation:

* Created a custom AI Log Analysis Agent using the `Agent()` class from the Strands framework.
* Defined a detailed `SYSTEM_PROMPT` to control agent behavior and enforce DevOps-focused log analysis.
* Integrated the `file_read` tool to allow the agent to access and analyze `.log` files.
* Configured a local Ollama-hosted `llama3.2` model for secure and offline AI inference.
* Implemented prompt-based log analysis for detecting INFO, WARNING, and ERROR occurrences from log files.

### Technologies & Tools Used:

* Python
* Strands Agentic Framework
* Ollama
* Llama 3.2 LLM
* AI Agents / Agentic AI
* Prompt Engineering
* Log Analysis
* DevOps Concepts

### Challenges Solved:

During development, I worked on:

* understanding agentic workflows,
* integrating local LLM inference,
* controlling hallucinations using system prompts,
* handling file-based analysis,
* and improving concise AI-generated operational insights.
